# RandomCompressFisherInformPerturbedLinearModel
On the Analysis of the Fisher Information of a Perturbed Linear Model after Random Compression
We have made a mistake in the published SPL paper. 
In the ensuring equation (8), the right lower matrix of the FIM and CRB should be the conjugate of the left upper matrix. 
See the  attached SPL_RandomCompression_CRB_MatrixPerturbation.pdf which we upload here.
